JSON Server is a tool for setting up a fake REST API with minimal configuration. It allows us to quickly create a mock backend that can be used for development or testing purposes. This server supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on JSON data, and it's especially useful for front-end developers when the backend isn't ready yet.

Key Features of JSON Server:
Quick setup: Instantly create a REST API from a JSON file.
CRUD operations: Supports all basic REST API methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE).

To get data from JSON Server in React, we typically:
 1) Set up JSON Server with mock data.
 2) Use Axios or Fetch API to send requests to JSON Server.
 3) Use React hooks like useEffect to trigger the request and useState to store the data.
 4) Handle loading, error, and success states to provide a smooth user experience.
