Class components in React have lifecycle methods that allow developers to hook into specific points during a component's existence. These methods can be categorized into three phases: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.

1. Mounting Phase (Component is created and added to the DOM)
constructor(props): Initialize state and bind methods.
static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state): Update state based on props.
render(): Return JSX to render UI.
componentDidMount(): Perform side effects (e.g., API calls, subscriptions).

2. Updating Phase (Component re-renders due to state/props changes)
static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state): Update state based on new props.
shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState): Decide if re-rendering is necessary.
render(): Return updated JSX.
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState): Capture DOM info (e.g., scroll position).
componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot): Perform side effects after update.

3. Unmounting Phase (Component is removed from the DOM)
componentWillUnmount(): Cleanup (e.g., remove event listeners, cancel API calls).
